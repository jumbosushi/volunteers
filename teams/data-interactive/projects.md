## Data Projects

## Interactive Projects

### The best views on campus

Present a series of 360 degree photos and/or video of different scenic spots on campus.

### Getting to UBC

Follow a day-in-the-life of UBC commuter students from different parts of the Lower Mainland. What's it like to transit from Surrey? Biking from Kits?

Present 3-4 parallel journeys on a timeline (Adam gets up at 730 in his Kitsilano basement suite -- meanwhile, Sally is already on the bus in Richmond).

Include plenty of multimedia -- photos, videos, audio recordings.

### Where to get coffee on campus

User enters a series of preferences (price, quality, etc) and we show them where they should go to grab a cup of joe.

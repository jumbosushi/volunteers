## Ubyssey Magazine Microsite - Project Plan

The project is going to be divided into two phases: **design** and **development**.

### Design

We talked about how we want to structure the microsite and came up with the following:

- Landing page 
- Article page (3 varieties)
- Navigation
- Header & Footer

**Landing Page**

- one cover article 
- several "featured" articles
- a listing of all articles in the magazine

**Article Page**

To add some variety to the site, we want to have three different article templates to pick from. They'll all share common components, but the way they're layed out will be different.

Every article will have the following:

- headline
- featured image
- snippet 
- body text
- images
- pull quotes

**Navigation**

We want some way of navigating from one article to another. This could be accomplished by having "related articles" at the bottom of each article, or by using some sort of table of contents.

**Header & Footer**

We need a consistent header and footer across all pages that links back to the magazine landing page, as well as the main Ubyssey site.

### Development

We'll be working out of the `ubyssey-dispatch-theme` repository.

The main development tasks will be:

- Implement landing page view (Python)
- Implement article page view (Python)
- Create a CSS stylesheet with common styles (CSS)
- Create landing page template (HTML/CSS)
- Create article 1 page template (HTML/CSS)
- Create article 2 page template (HTML/CSS)
- Create article 3 page template (HTML/CSS)
- Create navigation template (HTML/CSS)
- Create footer template (HTML/CSS)
- Create header template (HTML/CSS)
- Add animations/special effects (CSS/JavaScript)

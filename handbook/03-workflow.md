## Workflow

_How we get stuff done on the web team_

School is busy and everybody has different schedules, so it's sometimes hard to work on a large team. Apart from weekly meetings, we rarely see everybody in one place. To improve our efficiency and make communication easier, we use Slack and GitHub to stay connected throughout the school week.

### GitHub Workflow

GitHub is where we write all of our code. For those of you who haven't used GitHub before, I highly recommend reading the [GitHub Hello World guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).

To demonstrate how we use GitHub, I'll step through the process of completing an assignment.

1. An assignment is posted as a GitHub issue in one of the Ubyssey organization repos. The issue contains a description of the problem, and any extra information that might help somebody solve it.

2. A contributor sees the issue, decides that it's something they think they could solve, and assigns it to themself. This tells the web developer and the rest of the team that the assignment has been claimed.

3. The contributor creates a new branch that is specific to that issue. Any code for that assignment must be added in that branch. It is customary to prefix the branch name with the issue number (i.e. `65-broken-link`).

4. As they work on the assignment, the contributor may run into problems or require further clarification about the task. They can go back to the issue and leave a comment asking for help, and anybody else on the team can join the discussion.

4. After the contributor has made the necessary changes, they open a pull request (PR) from their branch into the default branch. Anybody can then review the pull request and leave comments. Once the code is given the go-ahead from somebody else on the team, it can be merged and the branch can be deleted.


### Slack Workflow

All communication outside of GitHub happens on Slack. Everybody will have access to the `#web-volunteers` channel, where we will be posting updates about assignments, meetings, and anything else related to the web team. Contributors are also encouraged to DM each other to discuss assignments.
